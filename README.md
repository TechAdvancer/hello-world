# hello-world
Just my first repo to learn git. Please ignore it. :)

Another commit FTW. I hope the future me doesn't read this and cringe at any fail here. 

Tech_Advancer here: I've been roaming around github for almost a year now and I've just been too afraid to make something public for the fear I'll be called a noob programmer. I now realize how silly that is, so I'm starting to try github yet again.
